          Vikram Design Studio is led by a multidisciplinary team of architects, designers, visualizers, and technical
          experts working across diverse project scales. With our roots in Chennai and a growing studio in Kolkata, we
          function as a collaborative, meritocratic grounded in shared values and a design-first approach.

        <p className="font-inter font-normal text-[16px] leading-[140%] tracking-[0]">
          While Guwahati remains our operational core, major design decisions are currently driven from our Kolkata
          studio, which will expand into a larger space next year. This dual presence helps us stay regionally rooted while
          scaling outwardly.
        </p>
        <p className="font-inter font-normal text-[16px] leading-[140%] tracking-[0]">
          Our studio values clarity, collaboration, and curiosity. We believe good design emerges from open dialogue,
          contextual awareness, and care for detail. Every member of our team contributes to a collective pursuit of
          qualityâ€”across architecture, interiors, landscape, and beyond.
